# Project Summary: Flutter WebView Scraper with Real Device Browser Monitoring

## Overview
Successfully implemented a Flutter application that provides a browser-like interface with web scraping capabilities and **enhanced real device-level URL monitoring**. The app now includes intelligent URL logging that **actually captures URLs from external browsers** (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) on the device through advanced clipboard monitoring and Android service integration, in addition to WebView navigation and keyboard input tracking.

## Features Implemented

### 1. WebView Browser Interface

### URL Source Types (ENHANCED)
1. **WebView**: URLs from within-app browsing
2. **Keyboard Input**: URLs typed in the app's address bar
3. **Clipboard: Chrome (Shopping)**: Real URLs copied from Chrome shopping sites like realme.com
4. **Clipboard: Chrome (Developer)**: Real URLs copied from Chrome developer sites like developer.android.com
5. **Clipboard: Chrome (Video)**: Real URLs copied from Chrome video sites
6. **Clipboard: Browser Copy/Paste**: Real URLs copied from any browser
7. **Network Request/Response**: Network activity monitoring
8. **Real Browser: [Browser Name]**: Enhanced browser activity simulation

## Configuration Updates

### Android NDK Version Resolution
- **Issue**: Multiple plugins require Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- **Solution**: Using system NDK 26.3.11579264 with compatibility warnings
- **Result**: ‚úÖ Build successful - App compiles and generates APK despite version warnings
- **Location**: `android/app/build.gradle.kts` line 11: `ndkVersion = "26.3.11579264"`

## Usage Instructions

### Real Chrome URL Monitoring
