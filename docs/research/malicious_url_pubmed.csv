40567680,Enhancing phishing detection with dynamic optimization and character-level deep learning in cloud environments.,"As cloud computing becomes increasingly prevalent, the detection and prevention of phishing URL attacks are essential, particularly in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV) environment, to maintain service reliability. In such a scenario, an attacker could send misleading phishing links, potentially compromising the system's functionality or, at worst, leading to a complete shutdown. To address these emerging threats, this study introduces a novel Dynamic Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm with Deep Learning-Driven Phishing URL Classification (DAOA-DLPC) model for cloud-enabled IoV infrastructure. The candidate's research utilizes character-level embeddings instead of word embeddings, as the former can capture intricate URL patterns more effectively. These embeddings are integrated with a deep learning model, the Multi-Head Attention and Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Units (MHA-BiGRU). To improve precision, hyperparameter tuning has been done using DAOA. The proposed method offers a feasible solution for identifying the phishing URLs, and the method achieves computational efficiency through the attention mechanism and dynamic hyperparameter optimization. The need for this work comes from the observation that the traditional machine learning approaches are not effective in dynamic environments like phishing threat landscapes in a dynamic environment such as the one of phishing threats. The presented DLPC approach is capable of learning new forms of phishing attacks in real time and reduce false positives. The experimental results show that the proposed DAOA-DLPC model outperforms the other models with an accuracy of 98.85%, recall of 98.49%, and F1-score of 98.38% and can effectively detect safe and phishing URLs in dynamic environments. These results imply that the proposed model is useful in distinguishing between safe and unsafe URLs than the conventional models.",PeerJ.

40108268,Explainable TabNet ensemble model for identification of obfuscated URLs with features selection to ensure secure web browsing.,"Obfuscated and malicious URLs may lead to harmful content or actions to the system, such as downloading malware, phishing, scams, or adware. In the domain of cybersecurity, the identification of the obfuscated Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a concerning facet. This study proposes a Robust unified TabNet ensemble model for the identification of Malicious URLs with feature extraction based on the computation of features' importance for classification. A fine-tuned attention-based deep neural network TabNet is used to extract the features of the URL. The customized data with the most important features is generated, and a Machine Learning (ML) ensemble model is developed for the classification of the URLs. The evaluation parameters accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score are measured to look at the performance of the TabNet ensemble model. Accuracy of 97.8%, precision of 0.978, recall of 0.976, and F1-score of 0.978 reflect the outperforming results of the proposed model while classifying the five URL classes. The model is further validated through statistical analysis by measuring the Kappa value, which comes up as 0.968 for the proposed model. With a 10-fold cross-validation model, we attained a mean accuracy of 97.27% and a confidence interval of 0.004. The Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME) explainable AI model is used to validate the model to perceive the contributing features towards the classification model. The results are compared with the state-of-the-art ML classifiers and the previous studies, and the whole validation process favors the proposed model's efficacy.",Scientific reports,"Naseer, Ullah, Saeed, Algarni, Zhao",2025,10.1038/s41598-025-93286-w,PMC11923084,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40108268,"Rafsanjani, A. S. et al.

39994324,An integrated CSPPC and BiLSTM framework for malicious URL detection.,"With the rapid development of the internet, phishing attacks have become more diverse, making phishing website detection a key focus in cybersecurity. While machine learning and deep learning have led to various phishing URL detection methods, many remain incomplete, limiting accuracy. This paper proposes CSPPC-BiLSTM, a malicious URL detection model based on BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory, BiLSTM). The model processes URL character sequences through an embedding layer and captures contextual information via BiLSTM. By integrating CBAM (Convolutional Block Attention Module, CBAM), it applies channel and spatial attention to highlight key features and transforms URL sequence features into a spatial matrix. The SPP (Spatial Pyramid Pooling, SPP) module enables multi-scale pooling. Finally, a fully connected layer fuses features, and dropout regularization enhances robustness. Compared to CharBiLSTM, CSPPC-BiLSTM significantly improves detection accuracy. Evaluated on two datasets, Grambedding (balanced) and Mendeley AK Singh 2020 phish (imbalanced)-and compared with six baselines, it demonstrates strong generalization and accuracy. Ablation experiments confirm the critical role of CBAM and SPP in boosting performance.",Scientific reports,"Zhou, Zhang, Bilal, Zhou, Fan, Pan, Xie, Peng",2025,10.1038/s41598-025-91148-z,PMC11850714,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39994324,"Atrees, M., Ahmad, A. & Alghanim, F.

39448673,Phishing URL detection with neural networks: an empirical study.,"Cybercriminals create phishing websites that mimic legitimate websites to get sensitive information from companies, individuals, or governments. Therefore, using state-of-the-art artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to correctly classify phishing and legitimate URLs is imperative. We report the results of applying deterministic and probabilistic neural network models to URL classification. Key achievements of this work are: (1) The development of a unique approach based on probabilistic neural networks that improves classification accuracy. (2) We show for the first time in URL phishing research that a machine learning model trained on a combination of open source and private datasets is successful in production. The dataset is constructed from open sources like Alexa, PhishTank, or OpenPhish and, most importantly, real-world production data from EasyDMARC. The daily validation of the model using daily reported URL data and corresponding labels, both from open-source platforms and private production, reach on average a 97% accuracy on the validation dataset, labeled by PhishTank, OpenPhish and EasdDMARC where possible mislabeled data can not be excluded and was not possible to check due to large number of URLs. Feature engineering was done without third-party dependencies. Lastly, the evaluation of both deterministic and probabilistic models shows high accuracy on short and long URLs, where short URLs are defined as having less than 50 characters.",Scientific reports,"Ghalechyan, Israyelyan, Arakelyan, Hovhannisyan, Davtyan",2024,10.1038/s41598-024-74725-6,PMC11502860,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39448673,"Phishing activity trends report: 1st quarter 2022 (Anti-Phishing Working Group, 2022). http://docs.apwg.org/reports/apwg_trends_report_q1_2022.pdf.

38820435,An ensemble classification method based on machine learning models for malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URL).,"Web applications are important for various online businesses and operations because of their platform stability and low operation cost. The increasing usage of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices within a network has contributed to the rise of network intrusion issues due to malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). Generally, malicious URLs are initiated to promote scams, attacks, and frauds which can lead to high-risk intrusion. Several methods have been developed to detect malicious URLs in previous works. There has been a good amount of work done to detect malicious URLs using various methods such as random forest, regression, LightGBM, and more as reported in the literature. However, most of the previous works focused on the binary classification of malicious URLs and are tested on limited URL datasets. Nevertheless, the detection of malicious URLs remains a challenging task that remains open to research. Hence, this work proposed a stacking-based ensemble classifier to perform multi-class classification of malicious URLs on larger URL datasets to justify the robustness of the proposed method. This study focuses on obtaining lexical features directly from the URL to identify malicious websites. Then, the proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier is developed by integrating Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. In addition, hyperparameter tuning was performed using the Randomized Search method to optimize the proposed classifier. The proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier aims to take advantage of the performance of each machine learning model and aggregate the output to improve prediction accuracy. The classification accuracies of the machine learning model when applied individually are 93.6%, 95.2%, 95.7% and 94.8% for random forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost respectively. The proposed stacking-based ensemble classifier has shown significant results in classifying four classes of malicious URLs (phishing, malware, defacement, and benign) with an average accuracy of 96.8% when benchmarked with previous works.",PloS one,"Sankaranarayanan, Sivachandran, Mohd Khairuddin, Hasikin, Wahab Sait",2024,10.1371/journal.pone.0302196,PMC11142511,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38820435,"Liu Z, Jin Z, Shangguan C.

37765815,Classification of Malicious URLs Using Machine Learning.,"Amid the rapid proliferation of thousands of new websites daily, distinguishing safe ones from potentially harmful ones has become an increasingly complex task. These websites often collect user data, and, without adequate cybersecurity measures such as the efficient detection and classification of malicious URLs, users' sensitive information could be compromised. This study aims to develop models based on machine learning algorithms for the efficient identification and classification of malicious URLs, contributing to enhanced cybersecurity. Within this context, this study leverages support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), decision trees (DTs), and k-nearest neighbors (KNNs) in combination with Bayesian optimization to accurately classify URLs. To improve computational efficiency, instance selection methods are employed, including data reduction based on locality-sensitive hashing (DRLSH), border point extraction based on locality-sensitive hashing (BPLSH), and random selection. The results show the effectiveness of RFs in delivering high precision, recall, and F1 scores, with SVMs also providing competitive performance at the expense of increased training time. The results also emphasize the substantial impact of the instance selection method on the performance of these models, indicating its significance in the machine learning pipeline for malicious URL classification.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","Abad, Gholamy, Aslani",2023,10.3390/s23187760,PMC10537824,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37765815,"Gupta B.B., Yadav K., Razzak I., Psannis K., Castiglione A., Chang X.

37362563,An intelligent identification and classification system for malicious uniform resource locators (URLs).,"Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a unique identifier composed of protocol and domain name used to locate and retrieve a resource on the Internet. Like any Internet service, URLs (also called websites) are vulnerable to compromise by attackers to develop Malicious URLs that can exploit/devastate the user's information and resources. Malicious URLs are usually designed with the intention of promoting cyber-attacks such as spam, phishing, malware, and defacement. These websites usually require action on the user's side and can reach users across emails, text messages, pop-ups, or devious advertisements. They have a potential impact that can reach, in some cases, to compromise the machine or network of the user, especially those arriving by email. Therefore, developing systems to detect malicious URLs is of great interest nowadays. This paper proposes a high-performance machine learning-based detection system to identify Malicious URLs. The proposed system provides two layers of detection. Firstly, we identify the URLs as either benign or malware using a binary classifier. Secondly, we classify the URL classes based on their feature into five classes: benign, spam, phishing, malware, and defacement. Specifically, we report on four ensemble learning approaches, viz. the ensemble of bagging trees (En_Bag) approach, the ensemble of k-nearest neighbor (En_kNN) approach, and the ensemble of boosted decision trees (En_Bos) approach, and the ensemble of subspace discriminator (En_Dsc) approach. The developed approaches have been evaluated on an inclusive and contemporary dataset for uniform resource locators (ISCX-URL2016). ISCX-URL2016 provides a lightweight dataset for detecting and categorizing malicious URLs according to their attack type and lexical analysis. Conventional machine learning evaluation measurements are used to evaluate the detection accuracy, precision, recall, F Score, and detection time. Our experiential assessment indicates that the ensemble of bagging trees (En_Bag) approach provides better performance rates than other ensemble methods. Alternatively, the ensemble of the k-nearest neighbor (En_kNN) approach provides the highest inference speed. We also contrast our En_Bag model with state-of-the-art solutions and show its superiority in binary classification and multi-classification with accuracy rates of 99.3% and 97.92%, respectively.",Neural computing & applications,"Abu Al-Haija, Al-Fayoumi",2023,10.1007/s00521-023-08592-z,PMC10117275,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37362563,"Key Internet Statistics to Know in (2022) (Including Mobile) - BroadbandSearch.” [Online].

35645443,Applications of deep learning for phishing detection: a systematic literature review.,"Phishing attacks aim to steal confidential information using sophisticated methods, techniques, and tools such as phishing through content injection, social engineering, online social networks, and mobile applications. To avoid and mitigate the risks of these attacks, several phishing detection approaches were developed, among which deep learning algorithms provided promising results. However, the results and the corresponding lessons learned are fragmented over many different studies and there is a lack of a systematic overview of the use of deep learning algorithms in phishing detection. Hence, we performed a systematic literature review (SLR) to identify, assess, and synthesize the results on deep learning approaches for phishing detection as reported by the selected scientific publications. We address nine research questions and provide an overview of how deep learning algorithms have been used for phishing detection from several aspects. In total, 43 journal articles were selected from electronic databases to derive the answers for the defined research questions. Our SLR study shows that except for one study, all the provided models applied supervised deep learning algorithms. The widely used data sources were URL-related data, third party information on the website, website content-related data, and email. The most used deep learning algorithms were deep neural networks (DNN), convolutional neural networks, and recurrent neural networks/long short-term memory networks. DNN and hybrid deep learning algorithms provided the best performance among other deep learning-based algorithms. 72% of the studies did not apply any feature selection algorithm to build the prediction model. PhishTank was the most used dataset among other datasets. While Keras and Tensorflow were the most preferred deep learning frameworks, 46% of the articles did not mention any framework. This study also highlights several challenges for phishing detection to pave the way for further research.",Knowledge and information systems,"Catal, Giray, Tekinerdogan, Kumar, Shukla",2022,10.1007/s10115-022-01672-x,PMC9125357,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35645443,"Abed W, Sharma S, Sutton R, Motwani A.

35591061,Cyber Threat Intelligence-Based Malicious URL Detection Model Using Ensemble Learning.,"Web applications have become ubiquitous for many business sectors due to their platform independence and low operation cost. Billions of users are visiting these applications to accomplish their daily tasks. However, many of these applications are either vulnerable to web defacement attacks or created and managed by hackers such as fraudulent and phishing websites. Detecting malicious websites is essential to prevent the spreading of malware and protect end-users from being victims. However, most existing solutions rely on extracting features from the website's content which can be harmful to the detection machines themselves and subject to obfuscations. Detecting malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) is safer and more efficient than content analysis. However, the detection of malicious URLs is still not well addressed due to insufficient features and inaccurate classification. This study aims at improving the detection accuracy of malicious URL detection by designing and developing a cyber threat intelligence-based malicious URL detection model using two-stage ensemble learning. The cyber threat intelligence-based features are extracted from web searches to improve detection accuracy. Cybersecurity analysts and users reports around the globe can provide important information regarding malicious websites. Therefore, cyber threat intelligence-based (CTI) features extracted from Google searches and Whois websites are used to improve detection performance. The study also proposed a two-stage ensemble learning model that combines the random forest (RF) algorithm for preclassification with multilayer perceptron (MLP) for final decision making. The trained MLP classifier has replaced the majority voting scheme of the three trained random forest classifiers for decision making. The probabilistic output of the weak classifiers of the random forest was aggregated and used as input for the MLP classifier for adequate classification. Results show that the extracted CTI-based features with the two-stage classification outperform other studies' detection models. The proposed CTI-based detection model achieved a 7.8% accuracy improvement and 6.7% reduction in false-positive rates compared with the traditional URL-based model.","Sensors (Basel, Switzerland)","Ghaleb, Alsaedi, Saeed, Ahmad, Alasli",2022,10.3390/s22093373,PMC9101641,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35591061,"Jang-Jaccard J., Nepal S.

34634081,Detecting phishing websites using machine learning technique.,"In recent years, advancements in Internet and cloud technologies have led to a significant increase in electronic trading in which consumers make online purchases and transactions. This growth leads to unauthorized access to users' sensitive information and damages the resources of an enterprise. Phishing is one of the familiar attacks that trick users to access malicious content and gain their information. In terms of website interface and uniform resource locator (URL), most phishing webpages look identical to the actual webpages. Various strategies for detecting phishing websites, such as blacklist, heuristic, Etc., have been suggested. However, due to inefficient security technologies, there is an exponential increase in the number of victims. The anonymous and uncontrollable framework of the Internet is more vulnerable to phishing attacks. Existing research works show that the performance of the phishing detection system is limited. There is a demand for an intelligent technique to protect users from the cyber-attacks. In this study, the author proposed a URL detection technique based on machine learning approaches. A recurrent neural network method is employed to detect phishing URL. Researcher evaluated the proposed method with 7900 malicious and 5800 legitimate sites, respectively. The experiments' outcome shows that the proposed method's performance is better than the recent approaches in malicious URL detection.",PloS one,Dutta,2021,10.1371/journal.pone.0258361,PMC8504731,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34634081,"Anti-Phishing Working Group (APWG), https://docs.apwg.org//reports/apwg_trends_report_q4_2019.pdf

33572521,Malicious URL Detection Based on Associative Classification.,"Cybercriminals use malicious URLs as distribution channels to propagate malware over the web. Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in browsers to install malware to have access to the victim's computer remotely. The purpose of most malware is to gain access to a network, ex-filtrate sensitive information, and secretly monitor targeted computer systems. In this paper, a data mining approach known as classification based on association (CBA) to detect malicious URLs using URL and webpage content features is presented. The CBA algorithm uses a training dataset of URLs as historical data to discover association rules to build an accurate classifier. The experimental results show that CBA gives comparable performance against benchmark classification algorithms, achieving 95.8% accuracy with low false positive and negative rates.","Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)","Kumi, Lim, Lee",2021,10.3390/e23020182,PMC7911559,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33572521,"Kaspersky  Malware Variety Grows by 13.7% in 2019 Due to Web Skimmers.
